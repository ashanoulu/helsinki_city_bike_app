# Helsinki City Bike App

Helsinki city bike app - Demo application to demonstrate Springboot Rest API implementation and VueJs for front-end application

This repo consist of three projects
1. Data import project (Python)
2. Back-end application (Spring boot)
3. Front-end application (VueJs)

In each project, it contains a seperate README file with execution instructions. 

Note - Data import project - Validate data and migrate data from Excel to MySql DB

In this project it consists of large data sets. Because of the easiness I used python script to import data to MySql DB. 
To getting started first you can create database by running the SpringBoot application or using SQL script is available in Data import project and Back-end project. 
If you create databse by running the SpringBoot application you should change the application.properties file accordingly. 

`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop`
