# Helsinki City Bike App

Helsinki city bike app - Demo application to demonstrate Springboot Rest API implementation and VueJs for front-end application

This repo consist of three projects
1. Data import project
2. Back-end application (Spring boot)
3. Front-end application (VueJs)

In this project it consists of large data sets. Because of the easiness I used python script to import data to MySql DB. 
To getting started first you need to create MySql DB. SQL script is available in Data import project and Back-end project. 
To set up each project, there are README files with instructions.

If you have any suggestion or problems, feel free to contact me via [awalpita20@student.oulu.fi](awalpita20@student.oulu.fi)
